### How Do it Know?

Let's start afresh, but watch more carefully.


```bash
rm -rf /tmp/scratch; mkdir /tmp/scratch
cd $_
ls -al
git init
ls -al
```

Aha! `git init` created a **.git/** directory.
What's in it?

```bash
tree .git
```

Quite a bit. Let's modify our reporting function to watch it.

```bash
function state() { echo; tree .git; printf '\n===\n\n'; git status; }
```

```bash
> README
state
```

No obvious change.
**`git`** simply sees that there's a `README` file
that it doesn't know anything else about.

Let's continue to follow **`git`**'s advice.

```bash
git add README
state
```

Aha! Now there are changes.
And **`git`** *does* know something about the file.
Keep your eye on that file under `objects/e6/```.

What's left? The commit.

```bash
git commit -m'initial'
state
```

We've added two more objects.

Are all the things **`git`** knows about under `.git/```?
Let's find out.

```bash
git show
rm -rf .git
state
git show
```

We're back to where we started.
````.git/`` is, in fact, your entire git repository.
It's all there is.
It's where **`git`** stores everything it knows about.
Understand what's in it and you understand **`git`**.

And what were the three objects?
We'll see momentarily,
but first, try doing this yourself:

make a `state()` reporting function,
create a `/tmp/scratch` directory,
initialize the repo with `.git init```,
add an empty `README` file (name in all caps),
add it, and commit it,
watching each step with your `state` function.

Don't just watch and nod.

Now you see what each step's doing,
and what each message is telling you.

This is going to be our approach:

- make disposable, scratch, toy repos

- do tiny experiment-lets in them

- watch carefully what changes at each step

What will you get from it?

- an ability to hear what **`git`** is telling you

- a deep understanding of **`git`**'s design

- a way that works to understand the things we don't cover

Let's start to that to understand what's that `.git/` repo contains by
[looking at that simple repo again.](https://github.com/jsh/git-internals/blob/new-course/repos/the-empty-file.md)
