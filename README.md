## Git Internals Talk

These are notes for the exercises in [this presentation](https://prezi.com/xvvfo_dv0vlo/git-got-gotten-notes/) on **`git`** internals.

Run through the [checklist](https://github.com/jsh/class-checklist/blob/master/checklist.md),
then start [here](https://github.com/jsh/git-internals/blob/master/repos/on-the-surface.md).

I also offer links to [things you might want to look at](https://github.com/jsh/git-internals/blob/master/where-to-go-next.md) after you finish.
