### On the Surface

First, define a little, reporting function
to list the contents of the current directory
and run `git status```.

```bash
function state() { echo; ls -l; printf '\n===\n\n'; git status; }
```
It will save you some typing.

Next, use it to watch what's happening,
as you create a little, scratch project
and put it under **`git`**.

```bash
mkdir /tmp/scratch
cd $_
state
git init
state
> README
state
git add README
state
git commit -m'initial'
state
git show
```

*Something* is changing. How does **`git`** know?
